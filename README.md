# ðŸ“Š Supply Chain Analysis for AtliQ Mart

## ðŸšš Problem Overview
**AtliQ Mart**, a rapidly growing FMCG manufacturer in India, has been facing significant challenges in retaining key customers. Several major clients chose not to renew their annual contracts due to service-related issues.

### The Issue:
- **Speculation**: Essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a prolonged period.
- **Impact**: This led to deteriorating customer service, negatively affecting client relationships.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Task
The Supply Chain Analytics team was assigned the crucial task of tracking and analyzing key service metrics for customer orders. The objective was to monitor the following on a daily basis:

- **On-Time Delivery (OT%)**
- **In-Full Delivery (IF%)**
- **On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)**

### Goal:
Measure performance against the target service levels set for each customer, enabling swift action to mitigate any service issues.

## ðŸ“Š Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **On-Time Delivery (OT%)**
- **In-Full Delivery (IF%)**
- **On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)**
- **Line Fill Rate (LiRF%)**
- **Volume Fill Rate (VoRF%)**

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings
### Customer Satisfaction
- **Line Fill Rate (LiRF%)**: A higher LiRF% generally correlates with improved customer satisfaction, as it reflects the percentage of order lines delivered in full.
  
### Partial Credit
- **Volume Fill Rate (VoRF%)**: Unlike LiRF%, VoRF% gives credit for partial shipments, providing insight into the overall volume delivered.

### Analysis & Action
- **Identified Issues**: Analyzed and pinpointed specific products that were consistently delivered late.
- **Implemented Solutions**: Deployed real-time dashboards to monitor OT%, OTIF%, and IF% on a daily basis.

## ðŸš€ Project Outcomes
Over the past 5 months, the key performance metrics (**OT%**, **IF%**, **OTIF%**, **LiRF%**, and **VoRF%**) have consistently underperformed, falling short of the target service levels set for customers. This analysis highlights the need for immediate corrective actions to enhance service quality and customer satisfaction.
